    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        I have been working in technology for the majority of my career, and mostly in what I call the "front of the house" (I also use to work in restaurants while in college). This included training users to use software
        and mobile devices, performing business analysis for projects, project management, and product management. And while I have never worked as a developer or engineer, I have picked up a few things that allow me to
        dabble a little bit in some areas in support of projects and teams, mainly writing xml documents or sql query statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I moved into Product Management, and found myself doing more design of new features, I quickly realized how much I enjoyed the aesthetic of creating wireframes and formulating how to better the user interace and
        user experience. I wanted to take my wireframes and bring them to life! That has lead me here, to learning front-end web development.
